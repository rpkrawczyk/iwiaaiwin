Tool to visualise the problem of the optimisation process: if you
increase one of you parameters the other must be reduced. A Simple
tool for management purposes.

Usually in process optimisation you have parameters like Quality,
Time, Costs, Flexibility and the goal is to find the optimum balance
for the given process. But when increase one of the parameters the
other parameters must be reduced accordingly as the area stays the
same. This tool will visualise this.

This tool will help you not to run into the "I want it all and I want
it now" trap. For me it is an opportunity to learn JaveScript.
